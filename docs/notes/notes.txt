A1.4 Names:
We chose the names apartments and sublease because they represent the data they will hold. They are also separate because the process by which we pull the data will be different.
For the profile, that will hold more data such as favorites of the user.

A2 Project foundations + Views + Templates:
Views:
ListingView -
This view is for showing all of the listings. Currently it shows all the apartments we have added to the database. It doesn't look super fancy now, but we will work on the styling a bit later. We used a list view for this
since that class based view has all the functionality we need.

ListingDetailView -
This view shows the details of the listing. It is made nice with CSS. We used a detail view for this since it provides us with the details we need and allows us to quickly make the template which has had the time put
in for the styling.

About-
This view is a simple request. Since it doesn't need any data from the database, a simple request view is able to put everything together for this section.

Login-
We used this one to demonstrate httpresponse. Since we haven't learned about authentication in the class yet, we are using this as a placeholder until we add functionality to this page. This is why we used httpresponse instead
of some of the better options.

Bonus points:
Render and generic CBVs feel a lot simpler to use compared to the Base CBV and HttpResponse. They can be set up in only a couple lines and provide fairly advanced capabilitues.
The advantages of HttpResponse and the BaseCBV seems to be in our ability to add advanced functionalites.
Overall, it feels like we'll be using render or Generic CBVs a lot more often and sometimes use HTTPResponse and BaseCBVs for their flexibility and customizability.

Section 3 - Static files and UI styling:
We added a custom css file to adjust the layout and the font and colors. Right now, the layout is not fully satisfying what we're expecting, but more adjustments will be made later on. We chose to put static folder in the project level because we only have 3 apps, which we think there's no need to have static folder in each app. For cache busting, we implemented it using `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`. By doing this, we can make sure that the browser downloads the newest version instead of an old cached copy.

Section 4 - Creating the matplotlib chart:
We're not going to use matplotlib to generate our map chart, preferably we'll use front-end charts using Javascript.

It's understandable to utilize BytesIO to generate the chart in memory, this way it doesn't over utilize RAM usage for the matplotlib charts.


Section 6 - Creating APIs:
While we made both a manual HTTPResponse and JSONResponse API, we will primarily use JSONResponse for our APIs as they are simple and have all the
functionality that we need.

We are planning to serve the data on apartments that we have stored. You will be able to get our complete list of apartments or subleases in one spot
as one file. We also added search functionality, allowing you to search the name, address, price, and some other attribues. This is also delivered as a JSON file.
HTTPResponse also allows you to return different types of forms by changing the content type MIME. This can be flexibly used to return images, text, json, or anything else.
